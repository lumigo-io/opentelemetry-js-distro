 * To provide better support and better data-driven product decisions
 * with respect to which packages to support next, the Lumigo
 * OpenTelemetry Distro for JS will report to Lumigo on startup the
 * packages and their versions used in this application, together with the
 * OpenTelemetry resource data to enable analytics in terms of which platforms
 * use which dependencies.
 *
 * This behavior is opt-out using the `LUMIGO_REPORT_DEPENDENCIES=false`
 * environment variable. Additionally, data is sent only when the Lumigo endpoint
 * is the default one (as to avoid issues when tracing data is sent through proxies
 * like OpenTelemetry collectors), and it active only when a `LUMIGO_TRACER_TOKEN`
 * is present in the process environment.
